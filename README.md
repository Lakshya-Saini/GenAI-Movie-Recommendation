# Movie & TV Show Recommendation App üé¨üçø

## Description

The **Movie & TV Show Recommendation App** is platform designed to provide personalized movie and TV show recommendations using **Generative AI (GenAI)**. The app leverages advanced AI models and APIs to deliver tailored recommendations based on user preferences, custom queries, and streaming availability. The backend is powered by Python, while the frontend is built using **Streamlit** for a seamless and interactive user experience. The app integrates with the **TMDB API** to fetch movie and TV show data, and uses **OpenAI** and **HuggingFace** models to generate intelligent recommendations and explanations.

## How It Works

1. **User Provides Preferences**:

   - Users select their preferences (e.g., genres, streaming platforms) or type custom queries.

2. **LLM Generates TMDB API Query**:

   - The app uses **Generative AI** to convert user preferences into optimized TMDB API queries.

3. **Fetch Data from TMDB API**:

   - The app fetches movie/TV show data from the TMDB API based on the generated query.

4. **Format and Display Recommendations**:

   - The fetched data is formatted and displayed with details
   - GenAI generates a **"Why is it worth watching?"** explanation for each recommendation.
